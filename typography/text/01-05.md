| Rank | Pincers-pinching | Scissors-pinching | Overall
| ---
| 1 | 3 (2.5) | 3 (2.2) | 3 (2.3)
| 2 | 1 (2.7) | 2 (3.3) | 2 (3.2)
| 3 | 2 (3.1) | 6 (3.3) | 1 (3.2)
| 4 | 6 (3.7) | 1 (3.7) | 6 (3.5)
| 5 | 5 (4.4) | 5 (4.3) | 5 (4.3)
| 6 | 4 (4.9) | 4 (4.6) | 4 (4.8)

That is data from [an actual scientific study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13582831_Effects_of_shape_and_operation_of_chopsticks_on_food-serving_performance) into the effectiveness of different kinds of chopsticks and ways to hold them.
