Adding MathJax
==============

We don't include MathJax by default with the Electric Book template. It's big, and we'd rather you had the latest version.

To add MathJax:

1. Download the MathJax files from https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/releases
2. Unpack the files into this folder. That is, make sure the MathJax.js is in this folder.
3. In Jekyll's `_config.yml`, enable MathJax by setting `mathjax-enabled: true`.
