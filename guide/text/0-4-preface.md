# Preface

This guide serves three purposes. First, it explains how to use some popular open-source tools to make great-looking books, as print-ready PDFs, ebooks and dedicated websites.

Second, it documents our Classic theme, a vanilla design for books that is powerful and flexible. 

And third, this guide is an example of the workflow and the Classic theme in action.

We originally developed this workflow at [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com) for producing [Bettercare](http://bettercare.co.za) books, before using it for other imprints and for client work at [Fire and Lion](http://fireandlion). 

This guide to the workflow is a work in progress. You can contribute from the project page: [github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow](http://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow).
