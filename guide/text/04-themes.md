# Themes
{:.no_toc}

Our template installs a default theme (as a Ruby gem) called 'Classic'. This theme includes a set of stylesheets for four output formats: the web (`web.css`), ebooks (`epub.css`), print PDF (`print-pdf.css`) and screen PDF (`screen-pdf.css`).

You can override anything in the default theme:

1. by editing the template stylesheets for each book in its `styles` folder;
2. by adding your own alternative files to `_includes` and `_layouts` folders.

To see the parent styles and files you're overriding, [browse the Classic theme repo](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-classic-theme).

For more detail, see the [official Jekyll guidance on themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).
